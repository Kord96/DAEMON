# Virtual Assistant (DAEMON)

Nowadays the further development in Artificial intelligence is tickling computer scientists dreams
about the ‘machino-sapian’. This project probably will not introduce some evolutionary AI system or
create a conscious artificial life. But it’s aiming to seem as alive as it can be done. Beside helping in
the daily boring routines like remainder and etc. This virtual assistant is supposed to interact with
humans, recognise their voices and chat with them, pretend to ‘understand’ their feelings and
recommend music according to it. And of course to provide more cool ideas for future sci-fi movies
in which AI’s take over the world!.
